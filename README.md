Codes to illustrate concepts in Introductory optics. 

Superposition: this is about Fourier series to build a train of squared pulses. It outputs a simple animation that adds harmonics to illustrate what each plane wave does to the superposition and the effect of having more or less terms in the summation. 

Propagation wavepacket: this shows the propagation of a wavepacket through a dispersive medium. It was done to show a linear medium where each frequency component sees a different index of refraction, gets affected differently and then we can combine all the frequency components to obtain the final result. We had seen the Lorentz model previous to this class.
